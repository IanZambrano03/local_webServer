# local_webServer
Nothing more than just a simple local webserver 


This is one of my first networking projects, where I wanted to work on the basics and I went as basic as I could which was a local web server, using the ASIO library. 

The whole point of this project was the work on the fundamentals of a webserver; them being 
  
  1) Create a Socket: Use the socket API to create a TCP socket.
  2) Bind the Socket: Bind the socket to an IP address and port.
  3) Listen for Connections: Set the socket to listen for incoming connections.
  4) Accept Connections: Accept incoming client connections.
  5) Send Response: Send an HTTP response back to the client.
  6) Close the Connection: Close the connection after the response is sent.

I think I achieved that with this project!
